Objects of the Late Bronze Age constitute the greatest part of the Mycenaean collection. These come mainly from large centres of the Argolid, especially Mycenae, but also from Messenia, Lakonia and Attika. They were found mostly in graves and date from 1600 to 1100 BC. The precious grave gifts from the royal graves excavated by H. Schliemann at Mycenae at the end of the nineteenth century, are especially amazing. 
The display occupies the large central room of the museum's ground floor (Room 4) and a small adjacent room (Room 3). The finds are grouped chronologically and by provenance. The visitor is introduced to the Mycenaean civilization through documents relating to the archaeological site of Mycenae and the excavation history of the grave circles. They can learn more about the development of Mycenaean civilization, the different forms it took in various parts of Greece, the relations of the Mycenaean centres with other regions and the first appearance of the Greek writing. Two models of the citadels at Mycenae and Tiryns complete the display.
